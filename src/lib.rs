//! Performant implementations of various [streaming algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_algorithm).
//!
//! **[Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/streaming_algorithms) â”‚ [Repo](https://github.com/alecmocatta/streaming_algorithms)**
//!
//! This library is a work in progress. See the docs for what algorithms are currently implemented.
//!
//! See [here](https://gist.github.com/debasishg/8172796) for a good list of algorithms to be implemented.
//!
//! As these implementations are often in hot code paths, unsafe is used, albeit only when justified.
//!
//! This library leverages the following prioritisation when deciding whether `unsafe` is justified for a particular implementation:
//!  1. Asymptotically optimal algorithm
//!  2. Trivial safety (i.e. no `unsafe` at all or extremely limited `unsafe` trivially contained to one or two lines)
//!  3. Constant-factor optimisations
